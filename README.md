# aod6060LWJGL3Tutorial
This is a simple tutorial project for lwjgl. The reason why I'm making a tutorial is simple, there is a lack of content online for LWJGL 3 so I decided to work on a few tutorials for LWJGL 3 to show how it works for new users of the library. This tutorial will cover the basics of how to setup LWJGL 3 in eclipse to more advance topics like how to create a simple Blinn Phong multilight system using GLSL. The tutorial will be first in text and then I'll create a video on youtube to show what I did for the tutorial. I'll post linkes for each corrisponding text and video.
